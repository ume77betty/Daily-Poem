#### **---About Daily-Poem---**
It's a practice for **SCSS, API and RWD**.
<br />
Just click the button, and this Web App can randomly generate a poem for you.
<br />
All poems in the Web App are from [Poemist](https://www.poemist.com/). Thanks for their API! I think this API is really cool.
<br />
<br />
Click the poem title or poet will lead you to the Poemist for further information.
<br />
Although there're some poems with some languages that we don't understand. That's okay.
<br />
If you're really interested in the content of the poem, Google will be a great helper!
<br />
<br />
A little secret about this Web App is that background color also generate randomly.
<br />
I matched a few sets of colors that I think it's look good. I wish you think so too.
<br />
Background color inspirations are from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), it's really helpful!

I wish all of you enjoy this Web App, I really enjoy coding this Web App. :)
